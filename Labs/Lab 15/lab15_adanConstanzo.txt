1. (5 pts) NASA wants to link n stations spread over 
the country using communication channels. Each pair of stations has a 
different bandwidth available, which is known a priori. NASA wants to 
select n-1 channels in such a way that all the stations are linked by the 
channels and the total bandwidth is the maximum. Design an efficient 
algorithm to solve this problem in O(n log n) time.


A modificiation of the Kruslkal algorithm will be sufficient to obtain a O (n lg n) time complexity
By sorting them in decreasing order we can accomplish our goal.
